# 🚀 Frontend Deployment Status Update

**Timestamp:** October 22, 2025 - 10:35 PM UTC+2  
**Issue:** Frontend at `https://matc-site.vercel.app/` using localhost API URLs

---

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

The frontend deployment at `https://matc-site.vercel.app/` was showing console errors:
```
localhost:3001/api/website-pages/active:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
localhost:3001/api/partner-testimonials/published:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
localhost:3001/api/events/published:1  Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
// ... and more localhost API calls
```

**Root Cause:** This deployment was built before our API URL fixes were applied.

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Verified Configuration**
- ✅ `vercel.json` properly configured with production API URL
- ✅ Environment variables set to `https://matc-backend.onrender.com/api`

### **2. Updated API Services**
- ✅ All 29 API service files updated to use production URLs
- ✅ Removed all localhost:3001 dependencies
- ✅ Changes committed to main branch

### **3. Triggered Redeployment**
- ✅ Pushed changes to GitHub (commit: 53d4cbc)
- ✅ Vercel auto-deployment triggered
- ⏳ **Waiting for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)**

---

## 🔄 **Expected Result**

After Vercel completes the redeployment:
- ✅ All API calls will use `https://matc-backend.onrender.com/api`
- ✅ Console errors will be resolved
- ✅ Frontend will properly load data from production backend
- ✅ Full end-to-end functionality restored

---

## 📋 **Next Steps**

1. **Wait for Vercel deployment** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Test the updated site** at `https://matc-site.vercel.app/`
3. **Verify console shows no localhost errors**
4. **Confirm data loads properly from production API**

**Status:** 🟡 **DEPLOYMENT IN PROGRESS**  
**ETA:** 2-3 minutes for completion
